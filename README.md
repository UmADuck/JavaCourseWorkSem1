# JavaCourseWorkSem1

The task was to create a Spring boot application 
My personal task was to create code for solar panels

If the code is launched first time of this day you need to start application and make it work few seconds then to stop it( so that csv files for current day are generated)
Then start it again and you can type in address field in your browser localhost:8080/{class name}/{id}
class name is one of next: solarpanel, panelowner, sensor

Collection of REST requests are made using postman
